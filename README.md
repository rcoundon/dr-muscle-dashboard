# dr-muscle-dashboard

## What is it?

I'm a user of the excellent Dr. Muscle app for weight-training, if you're into strength training, I advise you to check it out at dr-muscle.com

The user community of Dr Muscle have been asking for some charts to illustrate how they're progressing so I decided to get in touch with Carl Juneau (the CEO of Dr. Muscle) to ask about getting access to the APIs so I start an open source effort to present the dashboards, and this little project was born.

It's still very much a WIP - if you're interested in contributing, let me know. Pull Requests welcome!
